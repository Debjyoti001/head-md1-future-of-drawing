# My Github Project
## Project: The Art Collaborator
### Hi, my name is Debjyoti Bhowmick. I am a Digital Game Design student at the National Institute of Design, Bangalore. This is the Atelier project for my Exchange Program in Media Design at HEAD, Geneva.

## Devlog

### 23.10.20
#### The aim of this project is to create a playful AI assistant like experience either in an exhibition or a product design context attuned for beginner/ amateur artists. Exploring ways to use user emotions to have the AI create and print art for the user to collaborate with.

### 23.10.25
#### Currently thinking of fixed emotional states to choose from to denote a set variety of emotions to create with. I am hoping to translate these inputs into line weights/ thicknesses to create randomised artwork outputs. This idea shows promise.

### 23.10.30

#### Today was the first prototype test day. My prototype focused on inputs from three emotional states but Alexia had a comment that stuck with me "Is there any emotional expression option for me, pregnant and tired?" Most of the other testing went fine but now I am wondering whether fixed emotional states to choose from is really a good option if I want the user to be able to connect with the experience I am building.  
#### The gist of my research until this point has been linked herewith:

#### Another problem I have run into is with the projected user journey.

#### I received unanimous feedback that I am trying to target too wide of a target audience. Douglas said that a good product can be not for everyone, we must pick our battles.

#### Last prototype update was a few days ago. Have no been able to definitively solve the problem with user input for a variety of emotional spectrums yet. Thinkng of implementing emotional slider input methods into the user expereince to allow for the 'device' to recognise a wide variety of emotional inputs. Hoping this idea works out. Inted outcome will be somewhat on these lines:

### 23.11.11
#### Today's work has been about moving away from purely color based user input and coming up with user input ideas focused more on shapes and sensors. Maybe placing certain objects in the device could generate the automated visuals I have been seeking? 
#### ![Prototype 3-1](https://github.com/Debjyoti001/head-md1-future-of-drawing/assets/149476943/76fdda3d-148b-4a57-bc45-3280c1480b98)

### 23.11.15
#### The latest thought explorations have led me to work on a device with art exercises packed into a small exercises. My next prototype will be an attempt to create a device that holds up pieces of paper while it makes the artist do simple drawing exercises based on two attributes :
#### 1. A timer.
#### 2. A difficulty/ proficiency level.
#### 3. Feedback/achievements through an app. 
#### ![Prototype 4-3](https://github.com/Debjyoti001/head-md1-future-of-drawing/assets/149476943/beaf215a-268c-4a79-aeaf-6454785cb0ec)
#### User tests: 
#### Test 1. feedback insights: The timer and  in one place are too confusing. Hard to notice timer going down as time changes. Too focused on drawing. Finished drawing too fast.
#### Test 2. feedback insights: Hard to understand what the timer is, focus first went to diffuclty part of slider.
#### Device changes 1: added timer slider to the right.
#### ![Prototype 4-2](https://github.com/Debjyoti001/head-md1-future-of-drawing/assets/149476943/5c64cb4c-19e6-4d7b-8206-5371365ae584)

### 23.11.16
### Feedback (Mid crit presentation with Caran d'Ache)
#### ![Prototype 4-6](https://github.com/Debjyoti001/head-md1-future-of-drawing/assets/149476943/3c688035-b394-4d62-bf6e-64af3acc95e4)
#### 1. Could the sliders be integrated into the screen and turn it into a touch screen to decrease the elements in the experience?
#### 2. Maybe reimagine how the diffculty is spoken about, instead of judging the user with terms like 'beginner' or ,novice', the parameters could be visual. Eg: a turtle to a hare.
#### 3. Try to reimagine the feel of the smartphone like device, think of the act of flipping a sketchbook to make sketches. How could an experience like this fit seamlessly into a sketching session? This could help me move out of that 'tech' device like direction.
#### Sophie (from Caran d'Ache) asked multiple times for feedback about the user experience. Maybe auditory/visual feedback for successfully completing tasks? Or touch feedback in the form design of the device? 

#### IMPORTANT FEEDBACK FROM SOPHIE TO DOUGLAS REGARDING MY PROJECT: "Sophie wondered about whether the device could teach you stuff like shading? How do you turn this device into a methodical/ organic teacher? Think of how you can have a conversation with the device during the user experience, a sort of back and forth that can happen to create a mentoring experience for the user."

#### My feelings- Does it matter? :/ Gotta iterate! A lot! Scared about the upcoming electronics sessions! Slightly relieved because the faculty assured us that the device doesnt need to be entirely functional. Happy to have received positive feedback today! Looking forward to implement the changes as per the feedbacks!

#### Personal note: diversify the experience now. imagine a variety of sketching exercises that arent neccessarily challenging, but could move into different parameters of growth as an artist?
