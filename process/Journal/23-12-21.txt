3D modelling work mostly done. Feeling pretty confident about the 3D work done as of yet. Set an appointment with the Digital Atelier for opening day, Jan 8. Feeling under confident with the code and electronics work because I have not received my Electronics stuff I ordered yet. Will try and learn processing for Pi a bit during the break so that I am atleast somewhat prepared for when I receive the stuff.
