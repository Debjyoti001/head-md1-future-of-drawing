Updated the testing plan a bit for tomorrow. Finalising the testing prototypes. 
Soldering exercise done. Made a few mistakes. Burnt a finger slightly. Made a cold solder joint and then tried my best to fix it with a desoldering pump. Fucked up a bit here and there. Overally, I liked my progress. Not bad for a first timer I'd say. :D
