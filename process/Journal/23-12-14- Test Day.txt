Morning Session:
----------------

Feedback (Katya):
- "Amazing! Lets do this again!"- Wording unclear. Makes it seem like the same drawing will be repeated. (Normal Pot Device)
-  Would prefer buttons on the side, would prefer slider pot device shape because of personal bias. Would not prefer normal pot because it sticks out. Feels the slider pot device has more originality of shape.

Feedback (Flore):
- The bird iconography was unclear.
- Forgot to press 'Finish' after completing sketch. Was very involved in the process of timing the sketch right.
- Struggled to find Power button in Slider Pot potentiometer.
- Two seperate buttons for Reset/ Finish are neccessary. 
- Found the overall experience to be clear mostly. 
- Make clear instructions in a manual if possible. 
- Volume button/ slider- Lower volume option/ No volume option.

Feedback (Dorian):
- Visual iconography beside the slider/ normal potentiometer could match the visuals on the screen as a sign that user is supposed to use the pot to select from among options.
- Does not like the term 'Reset' as it could mean the repitition of the same drawing.
- After drawing completed/ failed, a Retry menu could be brought in again with same format as Difficulty selection menu. Then the slider/ normal pot could have multiple uses for the user experience and be as mono usage.
- The slider pot looks like a desk only device, the slider could be damageable. The normal pot device could be very portable with the normal pot having a small head to make it tkae up less space. 
- The normal pot device could also be used in one hand, if the pot and buttons could be pushed towards the middle. A smaller potentiometer head could be the difference between whether the user intuitively uses the device with one hand.

Afternoon Session:
------------------

Feedback (Leonie & Hanieh):
(Leonie has an artistic background and had important insights)
-Add options to timer? Allow pausing to timer?
-Remove judgemental features
-Focus on personalisation of the experience.
-Move away from trying to cater to all types of artist and try to focus further on a single type of artist. For example, either learning practice for beginners to intermediates or pure practice for experts. The product shouldnt cater to all types of users. Choose a lane.
- Hanieh did not like the timer ending and the failure screen at all. Hated the experience of seeings iconography like right and wrong. Focus on positive exposure for artists.

((REMEMBER TO GO BACK TO THE RECORDINGS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH))
