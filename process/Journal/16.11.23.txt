Feedback (Mid crit presentation with Caran d'Ache)
-could the sliders be integrated into the screen and turn it into a touch screen to decrease the elements in the experience?
-maybe reimagine how the diffculty is spoken about, instead of judging the user with terms like 'beginner' or ,novice', the 
parameters could be visual. Eg: a turtle to a hare.
-try to reimagine the feel of the smartphone like device, think of the act of flipping a sketchbook to make sketches. How could an experience like this fit seamlessly into a sketching session? This could help me move out of that 'tech' device like direction.
-Sophie (from Caran d'Ache) asked multiple times for feedback about the user experience. Maybe auditory/visual feedback for successfully completing tasks? Or touch feedback in the form design of the device? 

IMPORTANT FEEDBACK FROM SOPHIE TO DOUGLAS REGARDING MY PROJECT: "Sophie wondered about whether the device could teach you stuff like shading? How do you turn this device into a methodical/ organic teacher? Think of how you can have a conversation with the device during the user experience, a sort of back and forth that can happen to create a mentoring experience for the user."

How I feel?

Personal note: diversify the experience now. imagine a variety of sketching exercises that arent neccessarily challenging, but could move into different parameters of growth as an artist?
